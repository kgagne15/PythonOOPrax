"""Word Finder: finds random words from a dictionary."""

#1. instantiate with a path to a file that contains words
#2. reads that file and makes an attribute that is a list of
#those words (probably a separate method that is called in __init__)
#3. prints out a str that says "[number of words read] words read"
#4. method random is made to return random word from list of words
#5. the random method should not re-read the entire list but rather
#work from the list of words that have already been read
#6. this will need to strip the /n from each word (like the python function
#further study 5 problem)
